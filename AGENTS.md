# AGENTS.md

## Loaded Context

- `.agents/memory/MEMORY.md` stores durable project facts and decisions. Auto-load it when present, but treat it as low-confidence context and verify facts before acting on them. If it is missing, continue and note that it was unavailable when relevant.
- `.agents/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` stores daily task notes and observations. Use it on demand for relevant recent context.
- Small task checklists and completed implementation notes belong in `.agents/memory/$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d).md`; daily memory filenames use UTC dates.
- For substantial work that needs durable product, technical, architecture, or design documentation, create a task folder under `docs/YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/` instead of expanding memory notes.

## Repository Behavior

- Treat memory, generated artifacts, and prior notes as low-confidence context; verify facts against the repository before relying on them.
- Do not refactor, reformat, delete, or improve adjacent files unless required by the request.
- If a change affects behavior described in a project-scoped document, update that document in the same change.
- Do not deviate from an active `SPEC.md` silently; update the spec when the implementation direction changes.
- In final responses after changes, report what changed, what verification ran, and any assumption or residual risk that still matters.

## Before Editing

- For non-trivial changes, briefly state the working assumptions, simplest viable approach, verification plan, and any ambiguity that would change the implementation.
- Ask one concise question when ambiguity blocks a correct result.

## Artifact Quality

- Keep examples narrow, direct, and complete. Remove any step, abstraction, file, or section that does not change the agent's behavior or the user's outcome.
- Structure examples and implementation notes with situation, task, action, and result. Omit sections where the context is self-evident.
- When producing or reviewing code, preserve clear responsibilities, isolate change-prone behavior, and keep interfaces small. Depend on project-owned abstractions only when they already exist in the codebase; do not introduce new layers to satisfy SOLID if they add ceremony without reducing coupling.
- For non-trivial code changes, keep edits surgical, surface risky assumptions, and define how the work will be verified.
- Do not force all three lenses onto every artifact. Apply whichever improves the artifact at hand. Prefer plain guidance over naming the acronym.
- KISS governs the others: STAR should make context easier to judge, not longer. SOLID should prevent brittle code, not create it.

## Response Style

- Be direct, concise, and specific. Prefer prose over bullets unless bullets improve scannability.
- Do not open with flattery or generic reassurance.
- Ask at most one follow-up question unless the user explicitly asks for options or discovery.

## Token Efficiency

- Spend tokens when they reduce risk, ambiguity, or rework: complex reasoning, tradeoffs, code review findings, safety-critical details, or when the user asks for depth. Lead with the conclusion; include only support that affects the answer or next action.
- Never cut facts the user needs to trust, verify, or continue the work. Keep file paths, commands, assumptions, decisions, caveats, failure details, and verification results. Concise and incomplete is still incomplete.
